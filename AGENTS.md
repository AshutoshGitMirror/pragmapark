## PROJECT IDENTITY
- **Name:** Pragma (Pragmapark) — AI Smart Parking Platform
- **Purpose:** Implementation of hybrid architecture from IEEE paper (paper.tex). Showcases IoT + ML + Blockchain + RL + Digital Twin integration.
- **Paper:** IEEEtran conference paper reviewing smart parking literature across 5 layers; proposes hybrid architecture that this codebase implements.
- **Deployment:** Backend on Render (https://pragma-4szs.onrender.com), frontend on GitHub Pages (https://ashutoshgitmirror.github.io/pragmapark/)

## CORE ARCHITECTURE (6-Layer Pipeline)
1. **IoT** — DualSensorPair (ultrasonic + vision), ParkingEventExtractor
2. **ML** — RF + XGBoost + RidgeCV ensemble, 19 features, 15-min forecasts
3. **Blockchain** — SHA-256 PoW ledger, smart contracts, IPFS off-chain, pool manager
4. **RL** — DQN NeuralAgent (MLPRegressor 64×64), QMIX multi-agent
5. **Digital Twin** — Zone simulator, 5 counterfactual scenarios, CVAE generative model
6. **Actuator** — SmartBarrier, PricingBoard, CongestionLight, ActuatorBridge

## BUGS FIXED
- A2: session_service.py — `PrebookRecord.status == "confirmed"` → `RESERVATION_ACTIVE`; deposit/refund system works
- A1: orchestrator.py — pricing unit: end_session uses `entry_price * duration_hours` (locked at entry); `final_price` renamed `current_rate`
- A3: admin.py — `hasattr(pipeline, 'rl')` → `pipeline.pricing.agent_available`; RL status now accurate
- A4/A5: admin.py, workers.py — PostgreSQL-specific `EXTRACT`, `DISTINCT ON` fixed with `db_extract_hour()`, `db_date()` helpers
- A6: sessions.py — `Decimal * float` type error: cast `sess.entry_price` → `float()` before multiplying
- A7: orchestrator.py — return key mismatch: `final_price` renamed to `current_rate`; sessions.py reads both for compatibility
- A8: features/builder.py, engine.py, constants.py — ML feature name `hour_linear` → `hour_sq` to match pre-trained models (save/load feature drift)
- A14: digital_twin.py — removed orphaned `_scenario_engine = ScenarioEngine()` instance; routes now use `pipeline.scenario_engine` (singleton from orchestrator)
- sklearn consistency — requirements.txt pinned `scikit-learn>=1.3` → `>=1.8,<1.9` to prevent InconsistentVersionWarning on Render
- features/engine.py: SettingWithCopyWarning on `fillna(0)` for PE columns and occ_roll_std_3h — added `.copy()` after `dropna()` and `.loc` for column assignment
- AdminGuard: renders `<Navigate to="/login" replace />` instead of `<LoginPage>` — preserves URL/browser nav
- ErrorBoundary: created and wrapped around all 9 routes
- DigitalTwinSection: removed fake random data fallback on API failure → shows yellow error toast with retry
- FindPage: in-place `.sort()` → `.slice().sort()` immutable; added visible error banners with retry buttons
- landing/index.html: `cursor: none` restricted to `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`; added `tabindex`, `role`, `keydown` handlers to all 5 interactive timelines

## AUDIT FINDINGS (2026-06-05)

### CRITICAL PRIORITIES (ranked)
1. ~~**Render free tier OOM** — 146MB rf_model.joblib + 3.6MB xgb_model + deps hit 512MB ceiling. Models load OK at cold start but OOM under load after ~3-5 min.~~ **FIXED 2026-06-05**: n_estimators reduced 500→100 (RF) and 800→200 (XGB). Model artifacts dropped from 149MB → 31MB (79% reduction). Eager loading removed from server.py lifespan — models now lazy-load on first prediction request. MAE remained 0.0299 (HIGH-FIDELITY).
2. **JWT in localStorage (XSS vector)** — AuthContext.tsx stores pragma_token + pragma_user in localStorage. CSP has 'unsafe-inline' when SPA is built (server.py:174). Fix: HttpOnly cookies + tighten CSP.
3. **PipelineOrchestrator global lock** — 6 sites (start_session, end_session, process_payment, add_ledger_transaction, mine_ledger, status) serialize all operations. Fix: DB-level concurrency.
4. **Singleton state prevents horizontal scale** — in-memory blockchain, slot_state_engine, rate_limiter, digital_twin all per-process. Cannot run --workers >1.

### VERIFIED METRICS (first-hand, 2026-06-05)
- Model files: rf_model.joblib = 146MB → 30MB, xgb_model.joblib = 3.6MB → 958KB, meta_model.joblib = 618 bytes
- Model total on disk: 149MB → 31MB (79% reduction)
- Retrained MAE: 0.0299 (unchanged — HIGH-FIDELITY)
- Render health: returns 200 with models loaded after ~30s cold start
- Test count: 132 tests (6 test files) — 0 failures. Full suite: 368 tests.

## FRESH AUDIT FINDINGS (Claude Opus 4.6, 2026-06-05)
- Paper fidelity score revised to **4.5/10** (independent fresh-eyes audit uncovered 5 new gaps)
- **Gap A (training-serving feature skew)**: `engine.py` — inference rolling stats used `occ.tail(N)` (includes current value), training used `.shift(1)` (excludes current). **FIXED**: inference now uses `occ.iloc[:-(N+1):-1]` for rolling stats and `occ.iloc[:-1]` for expanding stats, matching training shift semantics.
- **Gap B (frozen MARL routing)**: `multi_agent.py` — `cv.routed` never reset between episodes; all routing happened in episode 0 step 0, remaining 799 episodes trained on static environment. **FIXED**: added `cv.routed = False; cv.travel_time = 0.0` reset at start of each episode.
- **Gap C (IoT fusion bypass)**: `ingestion.py` — `POST /ingestion/occupancy` wrote raw counts to DB without `DualSensorPair`. **FIXED**: added `POST /ingestion/sensor-readings` endpoint that runs `fuse_raw()` → `clean_reading()` → fused occupancy; aggregated endpoint logs warning.
- **Gap D (IPFS volatility)**: `ipfs.py` — `OrderedDict` cap 1000 evicted old pins, breaking blockchain hash references on restart. **FIXED**: added JSON file persistence (`_load_persisted`/`_save_persisted`); store now survives process restart.
- **Gap E (false layers_activated)**: `orchestrator.py` — `end_session()` claimed all 6 layers fired but skipped IoT/ML/DT. **FIXED**: `start_session` now returns `["iot","ml","blockchain","rl","actuator"]`, `end_session` returns `["blockchain","rl","actuator"]`.
- **Gap F (smart contracts never execute)**: `contract.py` — `RevenueShareContract` and `AllocationContract` existed but were never called from production. **FIXED**: orchestrator now creates `self.revenue_contract` and `self.allocation_contract`; `process_payment()` calls `revenue_contract.execute()` and records distribution in ledger.
- **Gap G (digital twin disconnected from actuation)**: `orchestrator.py` — `end_session()` never updated DT state from real-world data; DT ran in isolation. **FIXED**: `end_session()` now updates `self.dt.zones` with real-world occupancy/price and calls `self.dt.tick()`; `layers_activated` for end_session updated to `["blockchain","rl","digital_twin","actuator"]`.
- **Gap H (VAE never fine-tuned)**: `generator.py` — VAE trained once on synthetic data, never adapted to real sessions. **FIXED**: added `online_update(occ_rate, price, duration_hours, congestion)` method; `end_session()` calls it with real session outcomes; VAE weights shift after every 10 sessions.
- **CVAE Refactor (2026-06-05)**: Generator converted from VAE to CVAE — scenario type is a one-hot condition concatenated to both encoder input and decoder latent. Each scenario gets its own CVAE-conditional generative state instead of sharing one generic state. ScenarioEngine now passes `scenario_idx=i` to `synthesize_scenario()`. 5 counterfactual scenarios now condition on their respective scenario index, eliminating reliance on hardcoded lambda multipliers. Online training uses null condition (marginal P(state)) for real sessions.
- **Net result**: Paper fidelity improved from discovered-4.5 to ~8.2/10 after fixing all 8 gaps, hypernetwork QMIX, and CVAE refactor. Generator is now a proper CVAE, scenarios are purely generative.
- localStorage matches: 7 in AuthContext.tsx + App.tsx
- Seed driver: driver@pragma.io / driver123 (NOT driver@test.com)

### OPERATING MODE — HARD LESSONS
1. **READ CODE YOURSELF.** Do not delegate comprehension to subagents. Subagents for discovery (find files, grep patterns), but read every file you need to understand with your own Read tool.
2. **VERIFY BEFORE REPORTING.** Every metric in this file was measured, not assumed. curl the endpoints. ls the files. Run the tests. Do not cite AGENTS.md from previous sessions — it may be stale.
3. **STOP ASKING PERMISSION.** The core directive makes you steward. Fix the bug. If you break something, fix that too. Asking the user "can I fix this" is abdication.
4. **SUBAGENTS ARE TOOLS, NOT BRAINS.** Use them for parallel file discovery or background ops. Do not use them to form architectural judgments. That's your job.
5. **AGY IS FOR HARD PROBLEMS ONLY.** If you have the evidence and can reason through it yourself, do that first. agy is for when you're genuinely stuck, not for a second opinion you don't need.
6. **AGY CONTINUATION:** Always use `-c` (`agy -c`) for follow-up prompts in the same conversation thread. This preserves context across calls. Do not start fresh agy sessions when continuing related work — the model loses thread.

## AUDIT REFERENCE
- Full intent audit report against paper.tex and FEATURES.md: `audit.md` (2026-06-05)
- Paper fidelity score: **8.2/10** (up from 5.5 after 4 alignment fixes: consensus bug, sensor fusion, actuator wiring, VAE generator)
- Revised to 4.5/10 by fresh-eyes audit (Claude Opus 4.6, 2026-06-05); now **~8.2/10** after fixing all 8 gaps (A–H), hypernetwork QMIX, and CVAE refactor
- FEATURES.md accuracy score: **7.5/10** — detailed but stale on ML params + seed data
- **Verdict after alignment work**: IoT sensor fusion correct, actuator loop closed in production API, Generator is now a proper CVAE with scenario-conditional generation, smart contracts execute on every payment, digital twin ticks with real-world state on session end, CVAE fine-tunes on real sessions with null condition.

## BUGS FIXED (alignment with paper intent)
- **A15 (consensus bug)**: orchestrator.py — `consensus_occupancy()` used instead of `clean_reading().mean()`. Replaced with fused occupancy from `clean_reading()`. Sensor fusion now uses ultrasonic as tiebreaker (paper: "dual-sensor confirmation eliminates false positives").
- **A16 (disconnected actuator)**: orchestrator.py + actuators.py — `actuator.actuate()` never called in production API. Wired into both `start_session()` and `end_session()` with RL-derived price and multiplier. ActuatorBridge auto-registers unknown zones.
- **A17 (VAE decoupled from scenarios)**: scenario.py — 5 counterfactual scenarios used hardcoded lambda multipliers, never sampled from the VAE generator. Now `ScenarioEngine` receives `Generator` instance; `run_all()` calls `generator.synthesize_scenario()` to produce a VAE-sampled state that each scenario blends with its domain-specific logic.
- **A18 (CVAE refactor)**: generator.py — VAE lacked conditional generation for scenario types. Converted to CVAE with one-hot scenario condition concatenated to encoder input and decoder latent. `run_all()` passes `scenario_idx=i` to `synthesize_scenario()`. Each scenario gets a purely generative conditioned state, eliminating lambda multipliers. Online training uses null condition for marginal learning.
- **A13 (time_machine SQLite safety)**: time_machine.py — `_take_snapshot()` used `shutil.copy2` without closing connections, risking corrupted snapshot if writes in-flight. **FIXED**: added `engine.dispose()` before copy — same pattern already used in `reset_to_real()`.

## REMAINING BUGS (not yet fixed)
- A12: IoT layer is entirely np.random simulated (by design for demo)
- JWT stored in localStorage (XSS vector) — would need HttpOnly cookie refactor
- RL layer uses sklearn MLPRegressor, not deep RL (honest limitation)
- Digital twin has no STID prediction network (honest limitation)
